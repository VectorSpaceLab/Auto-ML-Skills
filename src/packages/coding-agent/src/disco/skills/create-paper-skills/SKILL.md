name: create-paper-skills
description: "Creates reusable Agent Skills from an AI research paper using the Paper2Skills Distiller workflow. Use when the user selects source=paper, provides a paper PDF, paper URL, arXiv id, paper title, or paper/repo pair, or asks to convert a scientific paper into skills with recovery experiments. Prefer a TOML run config; ask for missing paper, repo, recovery, runtime, and budget fields before expensive work."

# Create Paper Skills

## Purpose

Use this skill as the DisCo entry point for `source=paper`. It wraps the
Paper2Skills Distiller workflow in the same role that `create-repo-skill`
plays for `source=package`: collect the input contract, route to the correct
workflow skills, validate artifacts, run at least a meaningful recovery smoke
experiment when allowed, and produce reusable module-level skills.

Prefer a filled TOML config over free-form prompt fields. The reusable template
is bundled at `assets/distiller-run-config-template.toml`; a longer reusable
agent prompt is bundled at `assets/standard-distiller-run-prompt.md`.

## Source Modes

- `source=package`: do not use this skill. Use `create-repo-skill`.
- `source=paper`: use this skill, then load `paper-skills-distiller`.
- If the user provides both a paper and an implementation repository, treat the
  repository as pre-recovery evidence only. Recovery must not read it.
- If the source mode is ambiguous and both repo-skill and paper-skill flows are
  plausible, ask one concise clarification before starting.

## Required Input Contract

Before source downloads, environment setup, or recovery, identify these fields
from the prompt or config. Ask only for values that cannot be inferred safely:

- `config_path`: preferred path to a filled TOML config.
- `workspace_root`: workspace that will contain distillation and generated-skill
  outputs.
- `paper_source`: local PDF/text path, direct PDF URL, arXiv URL/id, or paper
  title.
- `paper_slug`: stable snake_case id for this paper/version.
- `original_repo_source`: local repo path, Git URL, `none`, or `unknown`.
- `source_acquisition`: whether remote paper/repo sources may be
  downloaded/cloned and whether title top hits may be selected automatically.
- `repo_discovery_mode`: `ask`, `auto`, or `disabled` when
  `original_repo_source` is `unknown`. Default is `ask`.
- `generated_skills_root`: output root for generated module skills.
- `attempt_dir` or permission to use the default distillation directory:
  `<workspace_root>/<paper_slug>/distillation`.
- `recovery_target`: dataset, split, metric, target value, and whether the
  agent should propose the fastest faithful target first.
- `recovery_mode`: `hard` or `soft`; default is `hard`.
- `runtime_constraints`: model path, environment path, GPU ids, network/API
  setup, and environment mutation rules.
- `iteration_budget`: maximum refine cycles after the first recovery. Default
  is `10`; the user may set any non-negative integer.
- `language_preference`: language for final user summaries. Generated skill
  artifacts stay in English.

If no `config_path` is supplied, create or request one based on
`assets/distiller-run-config-template.toml` when the run is more than a quick
one-off. For batch work, require a TOML config with one `[[runs]]` entry per
paper.

## Clarification Triggers

Ask before proceeding when:

- The paper title or URL resolves to multiple plausible papers.
- `original_repo_source` is `unknown`, `repo_discovery_mode` is `ask`, and the
  next step would search for an implementation repo.
- Repo discovery returns multiple plausible candidates or the selected top
  candidate is not clearly tied to the paper.
- The recovery target is unspecified and the next step would launch an
  expensive recovery; read the paper first, propose the fastest faithful target,
  and ask for confirmation.
- Recovery mode is omitted and the user request implies reduced/proxy success
  might be acceptable; otherwise default to `hard`.
- Runtime setup might mutate a shared conda/virtualenv environment.
- The distillation directory already exists and repairing/resuming could overwrite
  evidence.

## Required Workflow

Use the agent's todo/task-list mechanism for visibility. If workflow or
subagent facilities are available, use them only where they help parallelize
module skill generation or review; ordinary sequential Distiller stages do not
require workflow orchestration.

1. Load this skill and, for detailed rules, load
   `../paper-skills-distiller/SKILL.md`.
2. Validate the user input. If `config_path` exists, run:

```bash
python <skills_root>/paper-skills-distiller/scripts/read_run_config.py \
  <config_path> \
  --output <workspace_root>/distiller_run_config.normalized.json
```

For one run in a batch, also write a selected normalized run JSON with
`--slug <paper_slug> --run-only`.

3. Resolve remote or title-based sources before distillation initialization. Prefer
   `../paper-skills-distiller/scripts/resolve_sources.py` for local paths,
   direct URLs, arXiv ids/URLs, arXiv title search, Git repo URLs, and bounded
   GitHub repo discovery when `repo_discovery_mode=auto`. Record acquisition
   evidence, candidates, selected URLs, clone commands, and blockers.
4. Initialize the distillation directory with
   `../paper-skills-distiller/scripts/init_run.py`, preserving
   `iteration_budget`, `recovery_mode`, `generated_skills_root`, resolved
   `paper_path`, optional resolved `original_repo_path`, and selected
   normalized run config.
5. Load `../plan-paper-skill-modules/SKILL.md`. Extract/read the paper, create
   `paper_profile.md`, `module_plan.json`, and no more than five module
   documents under `modules/`.
6. Validate modularization with
   `../plan-paper-skill-modules/scripts/validate_module_plan.py`. Do not perform
   heavyweight model, package, dataset, or GPU probing before this succeeds.
7. Load `../create-paper-module-skill/SKILL.md`. Convert each module document into a
   generated skill under `generated_skills_root`.
8. Validate every generated module skill with
   `../create-paper-module-skill/scripts/validate_skill_tree.py --run-tests` and save a
   JSON log under `generated_skills_validation/`.
9. Load `../prepare-paper-recovery-env/SKILL.md`. Create
   `environment/runtime_handoff.json` and
   `environment/logs/command_log.json` from bounded runtime probes and active
   setup. When packages, model cache, datasets, or benchmark files are missing,
   use the prepare-env isolated environment/data acquisition path before
   deciding the stage is blocked.
10. Load `../recover-paper-result/SKILL.md`. Run the strongest feasible fast recovery
    experiment allowed by `recovery_mode` and `runtime_constraints`, using only
    allowed recovery sources. The recovery must exercise generated skills and
    save executable command evidence.
11. Run the recovery experiment validator and save
    `recovery/experiment_validation.json`.
12. Load `../analyze-paper-recovery/SKILL.md`. Write `analysis/analysis_report.json` and
    `analysis/feedback.md`.
13. If analysis returns `refine`, update the relevant module docs, generated
    skills, tests, runtime handoff usage, and recovery harness, then rerun
    validation, recovery, and analysis until accepted or the configured
    `iteration_budget` is exhausted.
14. Run the final Distiller artifact validator and save `final_validation.json`.
15. Write the organized final report with
    `../paper-skills-distiller/scripts/write_final_report.py`, then validate
    the `reported` stage. Final reports belong under
    `<attempt_dir>/reports/final/`, not in the generated skill directory or a
    top-level `Distiller` directory.

## Recovery Discipline

- `hard` mode must not accept proxy, toy, reduced, fallback, cache-only, or
  smaller-model recovery as success.
- `soft` mode may accept reduced/proxy recovery only when it is explicit,
  justified, executable, mechanism-checked, and validator-approved.
- Recovery must not read the original implementation repo. Use the paper,
  module docs, generated module skills, runtime handoff, datasets, and general
  public package documentation only.
- Do not report `blocked` merely because the active Python lacks packages
  (`torch`, `transformers`, `vllm`, `nltk`, etc.), because no local model cache
  exists, or because a dataset is absent locally. First run the allowed
  preparation steps: create/reuse an isolated environment under
  `$DISCO_CODING_AGENT_DIR/envs/` or `~/.disco/agent/envs/`, install the
  smallest required packages with timeouts, attempt permitted bounded model or
  dataset acquisition, and ask for missing credentials/permissions when they
  are truly required.
- If a user permits temporary simplification for this run, still create at
  least one data item, run at least one real training/inference/evaluation
  command when the paper task involves runtime behavior, and save the trace.
- Do not mark a run complete based on hand-written JSON artifacts alone. The
  primary recovery result must come from an executable command log.

## Output Contract

By the end, the user should have:

- A normalized run config or explicit record of prompt-derived fields.
- One distillation directory with the Distiller artifact contract.
- English module-level generated skills under `generated_skills_root`.
- Validation logs for module plan, generated skills, recovery experiment, and
  final distillation contract.
- `reports/final/final_report.md` and `reports/final/final_report.json`,
  alongside any verification or generated-skill review reports under
  `reports/`.
- A final summary in the requested language explaining accepted status,
  blockers, recovery evidence, generated skill paths, and remaining gaps.
